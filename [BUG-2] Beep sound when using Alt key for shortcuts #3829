Steps to Reproduce:

Click Settings â€“> Shortcut mapper.
Choose "Scintilla commands" tab.
Double click on "SCI_CHARLEFT" (or any other command).
Check Alt and S. Leave Ctrl and Shift unchecked.
Press "Add" to add this shortcut to the list. This will be second shortcut.
Press "OK".
Close the shortcuts window.
Try to use Alt+S.
Expected Behavior:
Everything works without beep sounds.

Actual Behavior:
Everything works but with beep sound (because Alt key is used for menu). Also if there is already menu shortcut for that then:

The menu will be opened.
Shortcut Mapper will not display "CONFLICT FOUND".
That mean it is 3 bugs in 1 (beep sound, menu opening and no CONFLICT FOUND label).

Also there is workaround for second and third bugs but not for the first bug with beep sound.
