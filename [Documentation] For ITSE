Documantation:

1- In Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 you will need to set the compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment.
In VS2017 you will be using /W4, which will pop some errors when building the Notepad++. You will need to turn it off so you dont have any
errors when building Notepad++.
--
WHAT IS /W4
/W4 displays level 1, level 2, and level 3 warnings, and all level 4 (informational) warnings that are not turned off by default.
We recommend that you use this option only to provide lint-like warnings. 
However, for a new project, it may be best to use /W4 in all compilations; this will ensure the fewest possible hard-to-find code defects.

2- For the once who want to build SciLexer.dll you can you the latest version of the boost which it located in this link, 
and it should be work with the VS2015, and VS2017.

3- time.h libaray

In C programming language time.h (used as ctime in C++) is a header file defined in the C Standard Library 
that contains time and date function declarations to provide standardized access to time/date manipulation and formatting.

4- _tzset 

The _tzset function uses the current setting of the environment variable TZ to assign values to three global variables: _daylight, _timezone, and _tzname. 
These variables are used by the _ftime and localtime functions to make corrections from coordinated universal time (UTC) to local time, and by the time function to compute UTC from system time. 

“_tzset.” _tzset, msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/90s5c885.aspx.

5- _stat/_wstat 

** The _stat function obtains information about the file or directory specified by path and stores it in the structure pointed to by buffer.
_stat automatically handles multibyte-character string arguments as appropriate, recognizing multibyte-character sequences.
** The  _wstat is a wide-character version of _stat; the path argument to _wstat is a wide-character string.
_wstat and _stat behave identically except that _wstat does not handle multibyte-character strings.

# For the timezone bug we needed to add the time.h in the common Header (C/C++ Header).
