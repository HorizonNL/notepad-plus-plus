Here is what we are going to talk about 

1- In Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 you will need to set the compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment.
In VS2017 you will be using /W4, which will pop some errors when building the Notepad++. You will need to turn it off so you dont have any
errors when building Notepad++.
--
WHAT IS /W4
/W4 displays level 1, level 2, and level 3 warnings, and all level 4 (informational) warnings that are not turned off by default.
We recommend that you use this option only to provide lint-like warnings. 
However, for a new project, it may be best to use /W4 in all compilations; this will ensure the fewest possible hard-to-find code defects.

2- For the once who want to build SciLexer.dll you can you the latest version of the boost which it located in this link, 
and it should be work with the VS2015, and VS2017.
